     <h1>About Arpitha</h1>
     <p>Hi. I'm Arpitha Rao (she/her), an incoming senior at UC Santa Cruz with a passion for using computer science to solve biological problems. My research at the UCSC Genomics Institute gave me the opportunity to use programming to learn more about neuroscience and cancer. In my MLH fellowship with Meta I am seeking to build on my computer science knowledge by leveraging strong scientific thinking and leadership skills. I am looking forward to an amazing summer!<p>
